# Clustering of B to D tau nu kinematical shapes


Requires flavio https://flav-io.github.io



### Output (global_results.out): 

 
* dGq2normtot(epsL,0,0, epsSL, epsT,q2): q2 distribution normalized by total,  integral is one by definition 


* I set epsR an epsSR to zero  as the observables are only sensitive to linear combinations  L + R

* columns: epsL, epsSL, epsT, q2, dGq2normtot(epsL,0,0, epsSL, epsT,q2)
