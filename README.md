# Clustering of B to D tau nu kinematical shapes


Requires flavio https://flav-io.github.io



### Clustering Result: 

data_w_label: clustering using as distance Chi^2(p1,p2) =  Sum_q^2 (Gamma_1(p1) - Gamma_2(p2))^2 with flat errors in q^2.  Clustering is performed with SciPy using Hierarchical clustering, choosing 3 clusters.
