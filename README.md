# B to D tau nu q2 distribution


## Output: 

### q2 distribution normalized by total,  integral is one by definition 

### dGq2normtot(epsL,0,0, epsSL, epsT,q2):


###  I set epsR an epsSR to zero  as the observables are only sensitive to linear combinations  L + R

###  columns: epsL, epsSL, epsT, q2, dGq2normtot(epsL,0,0, epsSL, epsT,q2)
