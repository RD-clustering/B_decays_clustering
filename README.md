# Clustering of B to D tau nu kinematical shapes

## Installation

**Essential packages**:

* ``flavio`` https://flav-io.github.io 

**Nice-to-have packages**

* ``gitpython`` (to have information about the git version with which 
    files were generated in the metadata file)

## Usage

### Step 1: Build histograms

Build q2 histograms for the different NP benchmark points.
This can be done with the command line interface:
        
    ./scan.py --np-grid-subdivision 3 --grid-subdivision 5 --output output/scan/quick

More information on the command line options can be found by running
``scan.py --help``.

This produces two output files:

* ``output/scan/quick_data.csv`` holds the data as a CSV file with the 
    columns ``index`` (number of the benchmark point), 
    ``l``, ``r``, ``sr``, ``sl``, ``t`` (the five Wilson coefficient),
    ``bin0``, ``bin1``, ..., ``bin4`` (the five bins of the q2 
    distribution). 
    
* ``output/scan/quick_metadata.json`` holds metadata (e.g. how many
    bins have we used, which software version etc.).
    It's a prettified json file, so it's pretty human readable.


### Step 2: Clustering
    
This can be done with the command line interface as well: 

    ./cluster.py --input output/scan/quick.out --output output/cluster/quick

This again produces two output files:

* ``output/scan/quick_data.csv`` containing the same columns as 
    ``output/scan/quick_data.csv`` plus an additional column ``cluster``
    that contains the number of the cluster
    
* ``output/scan/quick_metadata.json`` combined metadata of step 1 and
    this step.
    
Furthermore, a dendogram is produced automatically and saved at
``output/cluster/quick_dend.pdf``. Our example:
